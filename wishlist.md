# Bugs
- [ ] [line 2] Error at "x": Local variable is not used.
```js
x()
fun x() { print "hej" }
```
- [ ] REPL functionality performs static analysis prematurely (e.g. `var x = 3` results in an "unused variable" error)
- [x] Array method calls is not checked for immutability
- [ ] Struct `Set` expression should also handle assignment operators: +=, -=, /=, *=

# Wish list
- [x] Immutable-by-default (e.g. introduce a `mut` keyword)
- [x] Compile-time error to redefine variable/function
- [x] No semi-colons
- [ ] Change assignment to be a statement instead of an expression?
- [ ] Everything is an expression (because it's easier), alternatively make _most_ statements into expressions
- [x] No variable shadowing
- [x] Avoid local function variables overwriting function arguments (e.g. `var a = "local"`)
- [x] Static analysis for
  - [x] Simple dead code
  - [ ] Variables written multiple times without being read
  - [x] Using uninitialized variables (`var`)
  - [ ] Using uninitialized variables (`mut`)
  - [ ] `if` with constant conditional expression
  - [ ] Useless expressions, e.g. `'hello world'`
  - [ ] Function and variable names uses snake_case
  - [ ] Struct names uses PascalCase
- [ ] Optimizer
  - [ ] Optimize usages of literals in `var`'s. They're constants in pratice.
- [x] for-loop without sugaring (makes output code ugly)
- [x] Strong types by requiring variables to be initialized (later this may be handle by static analysis)
- [ ] Replace classes with 
  - [x] structs
  - [ ] interfaces
  - [ ] traits 
  - [ ] member-functions
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Experiment with bytecode
- [ ] Support for arrays
  - [x] Support for array literal
  - [x] Support for array length
  - [x] Support for push
  - [x] Support for getting value at index
  - [ ] Support for array indexing?
  - [ ] Support for map function
  - [ ] Support for filter function
- [ ] Support for maps
- [ ] String interpolation
- [x] +=, -=, *=, /= operators
- [x] Typing phase
- [x] Optimization phase
- [ ] Improve readme/documentation
- [x] Compile-time error if a variable is marked as `mut` but is not reassigned
- [x] `break` keyword
- [x] `continue` keyword
- [ ] A more convient way to handle a standard library
- [ ] Replace `return _` with `return`. Look at how semicolons are handling in the original implementation.
- [ ] Simplify code now that...
  - [ ] Variable shadowing is gone
  - [x] nil is gone
  - [x] for-loops can be made without an identifer (underscores are not required on unused loop counters anymore)
  - [ ] Classes are gone
- [x] Cosy playground
  - [x] Compile for JavaScript
  - [x] Make simple Cosy playground website
  - [x] Make playground available through github pages
  - [x] Scan + parse + resolve the code on keypress or after a timeout
  - [-] Syntax highlighting for codemirror
- [x] Make "Undefined variable" a compile-time error instead of a runtime error, e.g. `print "hej"\nasdf`
- [ ] Disable some static analysis for REPL, e.g. checking for unused variables
- [ ] Perserve empty lines and comments when pretty-printing and outputting to javascript
- [ ] Make semicolons trigger a warning instead of an error?
- [ ] Time a "real" project and do performance optimizations
- [ ] Algebraic data types
- [ ] Pure functions as default (cannot modify variables outside scope, must be deterministic, can only call other pure functions)
- [ ] "Transform" functions that promote data-oriented design; must be pure, must not include `if` + called functions must satify the same constraints. Could be done with annotations, e.g. `[transform] fn trans() { ... }`
- [ ] Better error position reporting with character from-to indexes
- [ ] A target that outputs code + documentation as markdown
- [x] `for 0..10` syntax, instead of `for _i in 0..10`
- [ ] Make a `strict` mode that requires specifying type information for function parameters and return values. It also requires functions to only access argument variables and local variables and non-mutable variables of outer scopes. I.e. it is not allowed to access mutable outer variables.
- [x] Rename files from `.lox` to `.cosy`
- [x] Change `fun` to `fn`
- [x] Change `"` to `'`
- [x] Consider integrations
- [x] Merge `Mut` into `Var`
- [ ] Need to take line breaks into account to avoid cases where parsing fails because it "continues" on the next line, e.g. `mut b\nb = '2'`
- [x] Remove unused testing code (Cosy.hx + tests/)
- [ ] Make array concat be simply `+`
- [ ] Perserve ordering of members when printing a struct
- [ ] Remove `Mutable` as a type in Typer and try an alternative implemention (e.g. metadata)
- [x] Make a new and improved Hangman example with properly typed code, structs and arrays
- [ ] Update Cosy basics example with structs, functions taking mut struct, string functions
- [ ] Submit Cosy example to "99 bottles" site (http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/submitnewlanguage.html)
- [ ] Cosy documentation using Dox (https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/dox)
- [ ] Make Cosy FFI work for more targets (see https://community.haxe.org/t/is-there-a-way-to-expose-a-haxe-library-as-a-library-for-another-target/508)
- [x] Make a `phases` sub-package
- [ ] Change array type annotation from e.g. `Array Num` to `Num[]`
- [ ] Maybe: Change type annotation from e.g. `Str` to `String` and `Num` to `Number`
- [ ] Maybe: Change type annotation from e.g. `fn F(blah Fun(String) Number) Number[]` to `fn F(blah: ((xyz: String) => Number)): Number[]`
- [ ] Compile errors ordered by line number, regardless of compilation phase (how?)
- [ ] Introduce an `Any` type that is only allowed for foreign functions
- [x] Add `--benchmark` option
- [ ] Ensure that global variables are defined before used
- [ ] Find a way to be able to parse mutually recursive functions that are not "late bound"
- [ ] Just for fun: Make a version of "generative grammar" that can spit out Cosy code and format that code using `--prettyprint`
